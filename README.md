# MATMyoSim-python

Implementation of (https://github.com/Campbell-Muscle-Lab/MATMyoSim) in Python. The repository aims to incorporate research from Dr. Surabhi Simha and Dr. Lena Ting, as in this paper (https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1113/EP090767) and this repository (https://github.com/Neuromechanics-Lab/Simha-Ting2023JExptPhysiol) in order to calculate static, dynamic and total firing rates as a function of force and yank on a bag fibre and force on a chain fibre for a single time step, suitable for a Reinforcement Learning environment.

Additionally, this repository aims to push research on the effects of variability in spindle afferent responses and its effect on standing balance.
